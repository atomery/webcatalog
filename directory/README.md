App directory for WebCatalog.

## Adding your app

If you have an web application you'd like to see added, follow the instructions.

## How it Works

This package is a joint effort between humans and robots.

First, a human adds an app:

```
apps
â””â”€â”€ google
    â”œâ”€â”€ google-icon.png
    â””â”€â”€ google.yml
```

The yml file requires just a few fields:

```yml
name: Google
url: 'https://google.com'
category: Utilities
```

The human then opens a PR. Tests pass, the PR gets merged. Yay!

Later, a bot comes along and generate additional files. Lastly, the bot publishes a new release to GitHub.

## Adding your app

If you have an web application you'd like to see added, please
[open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)!
All that's required is a basic YML file and a PNG icon.

### Adding your app by hand ðŸ’ª

An easy way to add a new app is to copy an existing app and edit its metadata.

To do so, create a new directory in the `apps` directory and include a `.yml`
file and `.png` icon file. The directory can only contain numbers,
lowercase letters, and dashes, and the yml and icon files should be named
like so:

```
apps
â””â”€â”€ my-cool-app
    â”œâ”€â”€ my-cool-app-icon.png
    â””â”€â”€ my-cool-app.yml
```

### YML File Rules

- `name` is required.
- `url` is required, and must be a fully-qualified URL.
- `category` is required.
- No fields should be left blank.

### Categories

`category` is required and must be one of the following values:

* Books
* Business
* Catalogs
* Developer Tools
* Education
* Entertainment
* Finance
* Food & Drink
* Games
* Health & Fitness
* Graphics & Design
* Lifestyle
* Kids
* Magazines & Newspapers
* Medical
* Music
* Navigation
* News
* Photo & Video
* Productivity
* Reference
* Shopping
* Social Networking
* Sports
* Travel
* Utilities

### Icons

- Must be a `.png`
- Must be a square
- Must be at least 256px by 256px. Should be at 1024px by 1024px.
- Must **not** be a copy of another company's or application's icon (see submission guidelines below)

### Company Logos and Names

We disallow apps that are using the names of _other_ companies or icons that we find too similar to the logos of other companies without verifying their permission to do so.

### Submission Guidelines

Some things to keep in mind when preparing your app for submission. Heavily inspired by the [awesome-electron](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron) submission guidelines.

- **The pull request should have a useful title ("Add ${AppName}") and include a link to the thing you're submitting and why it should be included.**
- If you just created something, wait at least 20 days before submitting.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
