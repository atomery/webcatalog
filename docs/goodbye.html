              <p>WebCatalog was started in 2016 with the aims to build a cross-platform app store for web apps. Since then, the app has been downloaded and used daily by thousands of users. While many users appreciate the productivity improvement the app offers, our primary goal to build an app store falls off with the rise of <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/">Progressive Web Apps</a>.</p>
      
              <p>To stay focused and keep the product going as a productivity app, we've made the hard decision to stop the development of WebCatalog for Windows and Linux. WebCatalog 12 will the last version of WebCatalog supporting these platforms. Still, it'll remain <a href="https://github.com/webcatalog/webcatalog-12">open-source</a> & available to download (<a href="https://github.com/webcatalog/webcatalog-12/releases">WebCatalog</a>, <a href="https://github.com/webcatalog/juli/releases">Juli</a>); and continue to work indefinitely without receiving any updates from us.</p>
                 
              <p>If you need any further information, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@getwebcatalog.com">support@getwebcatalog.com</a>.</p>

              <p>Thank you for using WebCatalog.</p>
