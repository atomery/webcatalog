      <p><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/native-apps-vs-web-apps-2373133">Native apps</a> are great. You can launch them quickly from your dock (or taskbar), resize the windows freely and are protected against web trackers. But sometimes, your favorite services don't have desktop apps. Instead, you have to access these services via their <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/native-apps-vs-web-apps-2373133">websites</a> which are as good as real apps.  
      <p>
        WebCatalog is a simple app which lets you turn any web apps (websites) into native-like desktop apps (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser">site-specific browsers</a>). These "apps" are not as good as native apps. But with WebCatalog, you can now <b>launch your favorite apps more quickly in self-contained, distraction-free windows</b>. Each app's data is stored separately, protecting you from cross-website trackers and preserving your privacy. Additionally, WebCatalog lets you <b>customize them with dark mode, colors, code injection & more</b>.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <hr>
      <h4 class="is-paddingless is-marginless">1. Install an App</h4>
      <p><small>First, launch WebCatalog and complete the initial setup process. The app has a small catalog of popular services which you can use to find and install your favorite apps quickly. If the app you're looking for is not in the catalog, you can use the "Create Custom App" feature. It only takes a few seconds for an app to install.</small></p>

      <h4 class="is-paddingless is-marginless">2. Launch an App</h4>
      <p><small>After the installation, you can launch the app from Launchpad (macOS) or Start Menu (Windows) and use it like any other desktop apps. You can also customize it to fit your needs.</small></p>
      <div class="inline-block"><a href="/images/screenshot_4.png"><img src="/images/screenshot_4.png" alt="Launch an App" class="screenshot" /></a></div>

      <h4 class="is-paddingless is-marginless">3. Uninstall an App</h4>
