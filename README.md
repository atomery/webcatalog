**[WebCatalog Lite](https://quang.im/webcatalog)** helps you turn any website into desktop app with just one click. It is the **incompatible** successor of [Appifier](https://github.com/quanglam2807/appifier).

> Originally, WebCatalog relied on [Electron](https://electronjs.org) to *appify* website into desktop app, which allowed its developers to customize and extend the functionalities freely. But Electron also had many quirks: each *appified* app included a heavy Electron framework, and it was cumbersome to bundle a proper Electron build system on 3 different platforms; etc.

> WebCatalog Lite app is still built on top of Electron, but it uses the installed browsers on your machine to power its created apps ([@vackosar](https://vaclavkosar.com/2018/02/25/Creating-Custom-Ubuntu-Web-Link-App.html), [@natermer](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7ivuit/create_firefoxbased_web_apps_for_gnome_and/)). So *appified* apps are always up-to-date with your browsers, and WebCatalog no longer has to do all the dirty works. The result is a new lightweight, maintainable, secure and up-to-date product.
